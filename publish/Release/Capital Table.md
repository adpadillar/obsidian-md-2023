### Starting Line

As of the date this contract's signing, we start at the following split
![Release_Capital_Table_Starting.excalidraw](../../Excalidraw/Release_Capital_Table_Starting.excalidraw.svg)
- Nicole has 50% of _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage
- Axel has 30% of _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage
- Nicole has 10% of _“growth”_ percentage
- Axel has 10% of _“growth”_ percentage

### _“Whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage (WIP)

This percentage type is almost completely unrestricted to what you can do with it, except with some ground rules that are in place to protect Release’s best interests. This rules will be defined in this section.

**When we include a new party and give them a percentage:**
1. We (Nicole and Axel) must both agree. Said party has to meet the following criteria:
    1. Believe in Release’s goals
    2. Bring value to the team

#### _“Growth”_ percentage (WIP)

The purpose of this percentage type is to allow for giving percentages to other people that may contribute to Release in the future. This percentage has some simple, but more restrictive rules (compared to the _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage). The rules are the following:

**When we include a new party and give them a percentage:**
1. We (Nicole and Axel) must both agree. Said party has to meet the following criteria:
    1. Believe in Release’s goals
    2. Bring value to the team
2. We (Nicole and Axel) dilute equally from our “Growth” percentages

It is important to state that both Nicole and Axel each hold 10% of _“Growth”_ percentage at the beginning (a total of 20%) so we can allow for 20% of Release to be given to possible future members.

We expect the structure to look something like this in the future:

![Release_Capital_Table_Projected.excalidraw](../../Excalidraw/Release_Capital_Table_Projected.excalidraw.svg)
- Nicole has 50% of _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage
- Axel has 30% of _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage
- Other parties have up to 20% of _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentage

However, this might not be the case. If for any reason after Release’s _“Growth”_ phase is over (this moment will be defined later in this section) and both Nicole and Axel still hold a *“Growth”* percentage, this percentage will be converted into _“whatever you want but not quite”_ percentages.

This means that it is possible that both Nicole and Axel exit the _“Growth”_ phase holding more that 50% and 30% respectively.

### “Growth” phase

We define the _“Growth”_ phase as the time period that starts at the date this contract is signed, up to the date when Release meets at least two of these criteria:

- Profitability: We define this point as Release consistently maintaining a positive net income for a consecutive period of at least two quarters since the start of the "Growth" phase.
- External funding: We define this point as Release successfully completing a second investment round with reputable investors.
- User acquisition: We define this point as Release reaching a significant milestone in user acquisition, specifically exceeding [insert specific number] monthly active users (MAU’s)
- Revenue: We define this point as Release achieving a substantial revenue milestone, specifically generating total revenue exceeding [insert specific monetary threshold]
