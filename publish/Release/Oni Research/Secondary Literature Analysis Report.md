## Mental health

### What is mental health?

Mental health is a subcategory of overall health, a category which includes physical health. It includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health relates with how someone handles stress, relates to others, and make choices. It in turn relates to issues such as alcohol and substance abuse and gender-based violence.

### Why is mental health important?

Mental health is important because it is a state of well-being linked with many functional aspects of life, from coping with stress, realizing abilities, and learning well, among others.

Approximately more than 300 million people, or 4.4% of the entire global population, suffers from depression.

### What are some determinants of mental health?

Mental health is determined by multiple social, individual, and structural determinants. Some of the determinants that increase the risk factor for mental health diseases include:

- individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance abuse, and genetics
- exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical, and environmental circumstances
- developmental incidences during childhood

### What are some ways that people suffer from mental health problems?

There are many mental health problems, but ones that are particularly prominent include:

#### Anxiety disorders

Characterized by excessive fear and worry and related behavioral disturbances. Affects 301 million people, including 58 million children and adolescents, in 2019.

#### Depression

During a depressive episode, a person may experience depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, or empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. This affects 280 million people, including 23 million children and adolescents, in 2019.

#### Bipolar disorder

People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms. Approximately 40 million people suffer from such a condition in 2019.

#### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

PTSD may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events. Its prevalence is high in conflict-affected settings, such as war zones.

#### Schizophrenia

People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy approximately 10–20 years below the level of the general population. It is characterized by significant impairments in perception and changes in behavior, including persistent delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, highly disorganized behavior, or extreme agitation. It affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people worldwide.

#### Eating disorders

Eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa, involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns. It affects 14 million people, including almost 3 milion people and adolescents, in 2019.

#### Disruptive behavior and dissocial disorders

In 2019, 40 million people were living with conduct-dissocial disorder. It is characterized by persistent behavior problems, such as persistently defiant or disobedient to behaviors that persistently violate the basic rights of others or other major age-appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws.

#### Neurodevelopmental disorders

These are behavioral and cognitive disorders that arise during the developmental period and involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor, language, or social functions. It includes disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD.

### What are some ways to care and treat for mental health?

The WHO recommends community-based mental health care instead of institutional ones, because it is more accessible and acceptable, helps prevent human rights violations and delivers better recovery outcomes for people with mental health conditions. This includes mental health services integrated in the general health care (hospitals, and primary health care); community mental health centers and teams; as well as services that deliver mental health care in certain social settings. Innovative ways, such as non-specialist psychological counseling and digital self-help, are also encouraged.

## Product design and mental health

### How can product design help with mental health?

Product design helps with mental health in that last category described by the World Health Organization: innovative ways that include non-specialist psychological counseling and digital self-help. This last bit, digital self-help, can be utilized by proper product design to help people with their mental health.

Accessibility concerns related to psychological issues themselves are already a core concern in product design. This is different from actually designing products for mental health, but they’re intertwined and is a core strength of product design.

Several mental health products are already available in the market. There are variations, but some of the most prominent include ease of access towards self-help resources such as meditation and counseling, provided by apps such as Headspace, Calm, and Insight Timer. Other apps, such as Wysa and Woebot, are more innovative in that they provide chatbot-based help, simulating interaction with an actual person or therapist.

### What features are commonly available in products that help with mental health?

**Some products help people access digital self-care resources, such as meditation help, expert guides, and creating relaxing ambiances, situations, or physical exercises.** These products include [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com), [Calm](https://www.calm.com), and [Insight Timer](https://www.insighttimer.com). These products are powered by the insight that meditation can help immensely with mental health. Headspace says that just one 15-minute meditation session with its app resulted in a 22% reduction in mind-wandering, and four weeks of daily usage resulted in 14% increase in focus.

**Innovative products include Wysa and Woebot that feature chatbots designed to simulate human interactions with a therapist.** These interactions are soothing in nature and can help soothe sufferers of mental health disorders through various methods delivered with the chatbot. The methods are usually not that different from the more classical products, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), journaling, and meditation. They have the advantage of being more intuitive to the users than classical, non-chatbot products.

Chatbots have been shown to have beneficial effect on helping people with depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.

One paper by A. Karahasanovic et. al. from the University of Oslo, which investigated the usage of a chatbot product for delivering mental health support to teenagers, identified four types of mental health support that could be given through mental health chatbot products: informational, relational, processual, and referral.

- **informational need** relates to the need to have access to objective information of direct relevance to the sufferers;
- **relational need** relates to the need to relate to someone beyond one’s network who can acknowledge and understand what the sufferers are going through;
- **processual need** relates to the need for the sufferers to take control of their own health and work towards empowerment in mental health issues;
- and the **need for referral**, that relates to the need to refer more severe sufferers to other services that are maybe more capable to give them assistance and support.

### What are some pitfalls that must be avoided when designing mental health applications?

As learned from the competitive analysis, some of the digital products that are analyzed have features that are known to be damaging, instead of helpful, towards mental health. These features include anxiety- and FOMO-inducing features, such as Stories and Streaks.

#### Stories

The stories feature originated from Snapchat, which is then transplanted into Instagram. By 2021, over 500 million people interact with the Stories feature on the daily.

This feature, which has become so ubiquituous, unfortunately has bad effects on mental health. They are less threatening — they disappear after 24 hours — and therefore feel “lighter” as cognitive load. People only post highlights of their life on these Stories, and coupled with the Looking-Glass Self theory, this feature has the potential to keep people stuck in a vicious cycle where the only way to push our confidence is to continue posting “perfect” projection of oneself. It also creates transient feelings of connectedness where there isn’t any, because it does not and can not take the place of speaking and interacting with actual, live loved ones; and over time, this can cause feelings of loneliness.

This feature, unfortunately, is available on one of the apps analyzed, called Insight Timer. It is even displayed prominently on the Home page of said app. Though this feature may satisfy business development interests, as evidenced by Snapchat and Instagram’s success, such an addictive and loneliness-inducing feature may be antithetical to a mental health application that is supposedly designed for better mental health.

#### Streaks

Streaks is a feature that measures the number of consecutive days that one has already used a feature. In this case, this feature measures the number of consecutive days that includes at least one meditation session.

This seems to be a controversial feature and conversations abound on the internet on turning it off. The controversy stems from the fact that meditation is all about letting go, while streaks seem to run counter to that idea. Andy Puddicombe, the co-founder of the Headspace app, has written an article defending the option to have streaks in his app.

On the other hand, streaks can be beneficial in that it encourages having a steady meditation practice. Puddicombe himself tells of his experience in a Tibetan monastery being a monk; meditation practices are quantitatively assessed and must be done per day. This reflects in the decision of his product to keep the Streak feature available.

In any case, it seems necessary to rethink this feature. Its existence in several of the apps analyzed through our competitive analysis can’t be switched off. It may be beneficial to add the option of turning it off, as in Headspace’s case, or disregard it entirely and switch to another idea on how to measure, quantify, and ensure progress.

### What is the business consideration for products that are designed for mental health?

The business consideration for mental health products are simply that the market for this kind of product is huge. The mental health app market in the US alone is currently valued at USD 4.2 billion (2022), with a compounded annual growth rate of 16.5% from 2022 to 2030, with a projection of USD 17.5 billion. There are currently about 20,000 mental health apps on the market today. This predicament is enough to make the case that mental health apps are profitable and desirable to market.
