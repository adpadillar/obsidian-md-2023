## Questions for next meeting

- [ ] Differences between calibration in experiment and in [[INC Mty]]
- [ ] Limitations for causing emotions through different channels (like video instead of audio)
- [ ] Experiment architecture change
- [ ] Experiment initial conditions

## Architecture changes

We are discussing some fundamental changes to the project architecture. 

1. Using **Unity for the multimedia experience** (instead of AI image generation)
2. **Choosing songs and assigning them colors**, then detecting the emotion of that particular color on each test subject (**instead of assigning songs to emotions** and then translating that into colors)

We should expand on both ideas and [[Minimum Viable Product|MVP]] both.
